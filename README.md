# CSVUtility

A couple of scripts that I use to read and write CSV files.

 - ***CSVReader***

   - ***Read (2 overloads)***: reads the document and returns its content as a string matrix.

 - ***CSVWriter***

   - ***SaveData***: writes the data into the document.
   - ***RemoveData (2 overloads)***: deletes the data from the document.
   - ***ReplaceData (6 overloads)***: swaps the existing data with the new one.
   - ***GetFullDocument***: returns the whole content of the document as a string.
   - ***FileContains (3 overloads)***: checks if the given data is in the document.
   - ***FileExists***: checks if there is a file at the given path.
   - ***CreateFile (3 overloads)***: generates a new document.
   - ***OverwriteFile (2 overloads)***: replaces the whole content of the document with the new one.
